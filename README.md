# Chroma-BanSync-Bot

This bot works with the FiveM script offered by ChromaLabs https://chromalabs.tebex.io/package/6315042

Ensure to rename `.env.master` to `.env` for your production environment. 

You can run the bot on any lightweight VPS, the bot is separate from the FiveM script to ensure that bans are logged even when the FiveM Server is not running. 

We understand that the permissions system setup here may not be a 1 size fits all solution so you are encouraged to make changes to suite your needs.
